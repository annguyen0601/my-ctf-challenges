# My CTF Challenges

This repository contains writeups for CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges I've solved.

## Writeup Structure

All writeups in this repository follow a consistent markdown format with **at least two required sections**:

1. **Description**: Details about the challenge including category, difficulty, and the problem statement
2. **Solution**: My approach to solving the challenge, including tools used, methodology, and the final flag

## Template

See [writeup-template.md](writeup-template.md) for a template you can use when creating new writeups.

## Example

See [example-writeup.md](example-writeup.md) for a complete example of a properly formatted writeup.

## Adding New Writeups

When adding a new challenge writeup:

1. Create a new markdown (`.md`) file
2. Include the **Description** section with challenge details
3. Include the **Solution** section with your approach and methodology
4. Follow the template structure for consistency

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as my personal collection of CTF challenge solutions, helping me:
- Document my problem-solving approaches
- Share knowledge with the CTF community
- Track my progress and learning journey
